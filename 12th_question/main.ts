// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”


const cars = ['Honda Civic', 'Toyota Corolla', 'Ford Mustang', 'Tesla Model S'];

for(let car of cars){
    console.log(`I would like to own a ${car}`)
}
